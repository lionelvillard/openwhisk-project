[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lionelvillard/openwhisk-deploy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lionelvillard/openwhisk-deploy)

This project provides a set of libraries and an CLI for deploying OpenWhisk entities 
specified in the format described below.
 
# Getting started

## CLI

```bash
$ npm install @openwhisk-deploy/cli -g
$ wskd -h 
```

## Node.js library

```bash
$ npm install @openwhisk-deploy/deployer --save
```

## OpenWhisk action

(Coming soon)

In your manifest, add:
```yaml
includes:
  - location: github.com/lionelvillard/openwhisk-deploy
```

# Features

The main features that are currently implemented are:
* concurrent deployment 
* automatic dependencies management (ie. actions in a sequence are deployed before the sequence itself)
* extensible deployment format via [plugin](libs/deployer/README.md) (experimental)
* [modular](docs/format.md#includes) specification

Supported action kinds: single nodejs file, nodejs module and 
inline nodejs code.

# Example

```yaml

# try-catch combinator example
packages:
  plugin-combinator-1:
    actions:
      safeToDelete:
        kind: nodejs
        code: |
          if (params.delete)
            return {}
          throw new Error('Oh No!')

      delete:
        kind: nodejs
        code: |
          delete params[params.delete]
          return params

      handleError:
        kind: nodejs
        code: |
          return {status: 'Um a very bad thing just happened - sorry?'}

      trycatch:
        combinator: try safeToDelete catch handleError

      eca:
        combinator: if safeToDelete then delete

      forward:
        combinator: forward ["authkey"] after safeToDelete with ["delete"]
        inputs:
          authkey: very private
          delete: something

      retry:
        combinator: retry delete 5 times
```
